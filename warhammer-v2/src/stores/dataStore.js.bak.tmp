/**
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED - ARCHIVED FILE ⚠️
 *
 * This file has been SUPERSEDED by the unified data layer in `data.js`.
 *
 * Issue #48: Unified Data Layer Architecture
 * Date Archived: 2025-11-02
 *
 * REASON FOR DEPRECATION:
 * This was a parallel implementation that was never fully integrated into the application.
 * It implemented Issue #47's transformData pipeline but lacked the complete API surface
 * (characters store, helper functions) that the active `data.js` provided.
 *
 * MIGRATION:
 * All functionality from this file has been integrated into `src/stores/data.js`:
 * - transformData pipeline (Issue #47)
 * - EntityReference parsing and validation
 * - dataQueries utility object
 * - optimizedMergedData derived store
 *
 * DO NOT USE THIS FILE. Import from `./data.js` instead.
