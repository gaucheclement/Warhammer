# Task: Implement Performance Optimizations and Accessibility

## Description
Implement description caching layer with LRU eviction, lazy loading for entity type generators, virtualization for long related entity lists, keyboard navigation improvements, screen reader support with ARIA labels, and performance profiling to meet NFR1 requirement (< 100ms render time).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Description cache implemented with LRU eviction (100 items max, 5min TTL)
- [ ] Lazy loading for entity type generators (code splitting)
- [ ] Virtualization for lists >100 items using DataTable
- [ ] Cache hit rate monitoring (target >70%)
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation without mouse (tab, arrow keys, shortcuts)
- [ ] ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader tested with NVDA/JAWS
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score ≥95
- [ ] Component render time <100ms p95 (measured)
- [ ] Description generation time <50ms average (measured)

## Technical Details
- **New file**: `src/lib/description-cache.js`
  ```javascript
  export class DescriptionCache {
    constructor(maxSize = 100, ttl = 300000) {}
    get(type, id) {}
    set(type, id, description) {}
    invalidate(type, id) {}
    clear() {}
    getStats() {} // Hit rate, size, etc.
  }
  ```
- **Lazy loading**: Use dynamic imports for generator modules
- **Virtualization**: Integrate with existing DataTable component
- **Keyboard navigation**:
  - Tab: Move between elements
  - Arrow keys: Navigate lists
  - Enter/Space: Activate links
  - Esc: Close modal/panel
  - Alt+Left/Right: Back/forward
- **ARIA labels**: `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `role` attributes
- **Performance monitoring**: Add timing marks, measure with Performance API

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 37, 38, 39 completed (core components)
- [ ] Understanding of Web Performance APIs
- [ ] Screen reader software for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24 hours (3 days)
- Parallel: false (needs core components finished)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Cache implementation complete and tested
- [ ] Lazy loading working for all generators
- [ ] Virtualization functional for long lists
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully functional
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score ≥95
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met and documented
- [ ] No memory leaks detected (tested with 50+ navigations)
