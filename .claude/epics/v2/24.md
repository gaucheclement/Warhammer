# [P0] Verify 8-step character generation pipeline in V2

## Priority
P0 - Critical (Blocking)

## Description
The root project has a complete 8-step character generation pipeline. V2 has all HTML files (StepSpecies, StepCareers, etc.) but implementation status is unknown.

## Current State (Root)
- Complete 8-step wizard: Species → Careers → Characteristics → Stars → Talents → Skills → Trappings → Detail → Experience → Resume
- CharacterGenerator.html orchestrates the flow
- Character.html manages state
- Each step has validation and transitions

## Target State (V2)
- All 8 steps functional
- Data flows correctly to IndexedDB
- Validation works at each step
- Navigation between steps works
- Character state persists

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Verify each step loads correctly
- [ ] Test data flow from each step to character state
- [ ] Validate step transitions (next/previous)
- [ ] Confirm character state persistence
- [ ] Test complete end-to-end character creation
- [ ] Document any missing implementations
- [ ] Fix or implement any gaps found
