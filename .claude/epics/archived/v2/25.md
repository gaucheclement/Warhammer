# Task: Project Health & Audit Corrections

## Description

Based on the comprehensive audit results (AUDIT_REPORT.md), this task addresses all identified gaps and inconsistencies to bring the v2 project to production-ready status. The audit revealed a 35% health score with several critical areas requiring attention:

1. **Task Completion:** Only 53% (7/13) of tasks are marked as completed
2. **Code Verification:** 4 completed tasks have no clear code implementation
3. **Documentation:** Only 20% (1/5) of required documentation exists
4. **Features:** 7/10 core features implemented, 3 missing

This task will systematically address each issue to achieve 90%+ project health score.

## Technical Details

### Phase 1: Task Status Review

**Open Tasks to Review:**
- **Task #10:** Database Import Integration - Check if completed or in progress
- **Task #16:** Unknown status - Verify current state
- **Task #18:** Unknown status - Verify current state
- **Task #19:** Testing, Optimization & Documentation - Has COMPLETE.md but status=open

**Action Plan:**
1. Read each task file and updates directory
2. Check worktree for implemented code
3. Update status field to reflect reality
4. Add completion documentation where missing
5. Sync with GitHub using `/pm:sync`

### Phase 2: Code Implementation Verification

- Expected code: search functionality, navigation components
- Check for: `src/lib/search.js`, search components, navigation routing
- Document locations in task file

**Task #22:** Data Management Features
- Expected code: data CRUD operations, admin interface
- Check for: data stores, data management components
- Document locations in task file

**Task #23:** Feature Analysis & Gap Identification
- Expected code: May be analysis-only, verify if code was needed
- Check task description and acceptance criteria
- Update status accordingly

- No warnings in audit report
- Ready for production deployment

## Implementation Approach

**Recommended Execution Strategy:**

**Option A: Sequential (Thorough)**
1. Phase 1: Task Status Review (2h)
2. Phase 2: Code Verification (3h)
3. Phase 3: Documentation (6h)
4. Phase 4: Feature Verification (2h)
5. Phase 5: Re-audit (1h)
Total: ~14 hours

**Option B: Parallel (Fast)**
- Stream A: Task Status + Code Verification (5h)
- Stream B: Documentation Creation (6h)
- Stream C: Feature Verification (2h)
- Stream D: Integration + Re-audit (2h)
Total: ~6-7 hours wall time

**Recommended:** Option B (Parallel) for efficiency

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- Audit report generated: `.claude/epics/v2/AUDIT_REPORT.md` ✓
- Worktree available: `C:/Users/gauch/PhpstormProjects/epic-v2` ✓
- All previous tasks data available ✓

**Optional:**
- Access to v1 application for migration guide
- Beta testers feedback for user guide improvements

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 14-16 hours (sequential) or 6-7 hours (parallel)
- Complexity: Medium (mostly documentation and verification)
- Parallel: true (can be split into 4 streams)

**Breakdown:**
- Task review & status updates: 2h
- Code verification & documentation: 3h
- Documentation creation: 6h
- Feature verification: 2h
- Re-audit & fixes: 2h
- Buffer for issues: 2h

## Notes

- This task is critical for production readiness
- The low health score (35%) is primarily due to status tracking and documentation gaps, not code quality issues
- Code exists and works, but needs better documentation and verification
- Most work is organizational and documentation, not new development
- Priority should be on documentation since code appears mostly complete
- Consider running `/pm:audit` regularly during this task to track progress

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Run final audit and verify 90%+ health score
2. Create GitHub issue for this task
3. Sync with GitHub: `/pm:sync`
4. Consider production deployment
5. Set up monitoring and feedback collection
6. Plan for v2.1 improvements based on user feedback
